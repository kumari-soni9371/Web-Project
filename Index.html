                <li>In a large bowl, add the whole wheat flour and a pinch of salt. Mix well.</li>
                <li>Add mustard oil, and slowly pour in water to knead the dough. The dough should be smooth and soft, like chapati dough.</li>

                <li>You can also add a little garam masala or chopped coriander leaves for extra flavor.</li>

                <li>Heat oil or ghee in a pan and fry the littis until they are crispy and golden brown.</li>
            </ul>

        <img src="img.html/Soup.jpeg" alt="Tomato Soup" width="300" height="200">
        <h3 style="color: crimson;"><u>Ingredients:-</u></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6-7 medium-sized ripe tomatoes, chopped</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1-2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1 small carrot (optional), chopped (for sweetness and texture)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp butter or olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp sugar (optional, to balance acidity)</li>
            <li>2 cups vegetable broth or water</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp dried oregano or basil (optional, for extra flavor)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp fresh cream or milk (optional, for creaminess)</li>
            <li>Fresh basil leaves (optional, for garnish)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 style="color: crimson;"><u>Instructions:-</u></h3>
            <h4> Prepare the Tomatoes:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Wash the tomatoes thoroughly and chop them into small pieces.</li>
                <li>Optionally, if you want a smoother soup, you can blanch the tomatoes in hot water for a minute, then peel off the skin and chop them.</li> 
                <li>This step helps make the soup smoother, but it's not necessary if you prefer a rustic texture.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4> Sautéing the Vegetables:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>In a large pot, heat butter or olive oil over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Add the chopped onion and sauté for 2-3 minutes until soft and translucent.</li> 
                <li>Add the minced garlic and sauté for another minute until fragrant.</li>
                <li>f you're using carrot, add it at this stage and sauté for 3-4 minutes to soften it slightly.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Cooking the Tomatoes:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Add the chopped tomatoes to the pot and cook for about 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes break down and release their juices.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Add Broth and Seasoning:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Add vegetable broth or water to the pot along with salt, black pepper, and dried oregano or basil if using.</li>
                <li>Bring the mixture to a boil and then reduce the heat. Let it simmer for 15-20 minutes, until the tomatoes and other vegetables are well-cooked and softened.</li> 
            </ul>
            <h4>Blending the Soup:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Use an immersion blender directly in the pot to blend the soup until smooth. Alternatively, you can transfer the mixture to a blender in batches and blend until smooth.</li>
                <li>If you want a silky texture, you can strain the soup through a fine mesh sieve to remove any remaining pulp or seeds.</li> 
            </ul>
            <h4>Finishing Touches:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Once blended, return the soup to the pot and bring it to a simmer again for a few minutes.</li>
                <li>Add sugar (if desired) to balance the acidity of the tomatoes and stir in fresh cream or milk to make the soup creamy and smooth.</li> 
            </ul>
            <h4> Serve:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Taste and adjust the seasoning with more salt, pepper, or herbs if necessary.</li>
                <li>Serve hot, garnished with fresh basil leaves or a swirl of cream, if desired.</li> 
            </ul>
